Modified_GibbsLDA++
====================

A modified of C/C++ Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation

This project is a modified version of GibbsLDA++-0.2 writen by Xuan-Hieu Phan and Cam-Tu Nguyen.

You can download the original version GibbsLDA++-0.2 from http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/

The original version can not produce the correct results if any of input document which length exceeds 1MB.

I just fix this limit.
